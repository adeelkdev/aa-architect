# AA Architect â€” React (Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind)

This project was generated from your uploaded components. It uses Vite, React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and shadcn/ui primitives already present in your `components/ui` folder.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- Your original components are under `src/components`.
- Main app entry is `src/App.tsx` and `src/main.tsx`.
- Tailwind is preconfigured in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css`.
- If any component requires additional packages, install them as needed.
- Static assets from your upload were copied into `public/` preserving structure.
